        country; by using Vivalis’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Vivalis will not rent or
        sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,

        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when

        third party or the public at large.</p>

        you up to date with what’s going on with our website and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this
        type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
        support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
        respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>
        <p>When the user registers on our website to purchase the products or services, they provide us with the email address and
        automatically agree to receive notifications of advertising, products, offers, services. You can change your marketing
        preferences or remove yourself from our mailing lists by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the footer of promotional
        emails, sending an email to support@govivalis.com. Sometimes it takes time for our system to completely remove it from
        the database, so we invite you to wait a reasonable time, in which you may receive service-related announcements.</p>
        <p>We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
